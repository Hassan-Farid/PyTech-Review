    Comparison Operators are important in the sense of checking conditions used in alternative or iterative programming
    THus, it is essential for one to have an understanding of the basic comparison operators
'''

#Assigning Values
num = 5

#Comparison Operator
print("Number is equal to 5: {}".format(num == 5))

#Not Equals Operator
print("Number is not equal to 4: {}".format(num != 4))

#Less than Operator
print("Number is less than 10: {}".format(num < 10))

#Less than Equals Operator
print("Number is less than equals to 2: {}".format(num <= 2))

#Greater than Operator
print("Number is greater than 10: {}".format(num > 10))

#Greater than Equals Operator
print("Number is greater than equals to 2: {}".format(num >= 2))

Task:  Once done with this stuff, you can perform the following task to check if you got it or not

Take the following inputs by providing prompts to user:

Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit: ___________ (Input in the blank)
Enter the temperature in Celsius: ____________ (Input in the blank)

Once input has been taken, you can use print formatting to display ouput in the format: (Use C = (F - 32) * 5/9 and F = 9C/5 + 32)

Temperature in Fahrenheit: -40 F
Temperature in Celcius: -40 C
Equivalent Temperatures for Inputted Temperatures is Same: True (Only displays True for -40 otherwise it will show False)

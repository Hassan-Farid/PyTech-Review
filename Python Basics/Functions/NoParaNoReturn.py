    Although the use of such functions is very rare, still this is the most basic form of a function that can exist.
    The No parameter No return value function doesn't take any argument values nor returns some value, instead prints it
'''

def print_hello(): #Takes no parameters
    print("Hello World!") #Displays the message "Hello World" whenever function is called
    
#Calling the function
print("This is the Hello method, which displays the message on screen: \n")
print_hello()
